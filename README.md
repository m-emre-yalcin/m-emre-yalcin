Hi, I'm Emre - a self-taught full-stack developer and **product builder** with a background in software engineering. I started early, learning to code in vocational high school, and have spent the last decade freelancing and building real-world tools that people actually use. I care about clean design, fast iteration, and solving real problems.

Outside of tech, I'm into things that bring balance: nature, blues music, running, mindfulness, and the occasional beer with friends. I recently built a diet app, inspired by my interest in health and well-being. My approach to life is holistic: I believe truth often lives between opposites and when Iâ€™m stuck, I look to nature for answers.

Always open to ideas, meaningful work, or just a good conversation.
